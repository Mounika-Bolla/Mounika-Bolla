# 🌟 Hi, I’m Mounika Bolla — Machine Learning & Agentic AI Engineer

I design and build production-grade AI systems and agentic pipelines that solve hard, real-world problems across healthcare, security, finance, and manufacturing. This page focuses on projects, technical approach, and reproducible artifacts — no employer or work history is referenced.

## 🔍 Core Focus

- Agentic AI & multi-agent orchestration for decision automation  
- Deep learning for time-series, vision, and multimodal data  
- Large language models, retrieval-augmented generation, and LLM orchestration  
- Production-ready MLOps: CI/CD, containerized deployments, monitoring and observability  
- Efficient inference and cost-aware model engineering

---

## 🔥 What I Build (Project Types)

- Real-time perception pipelines (video / edge / telemetry) with sub-100ms inference budgets  
- Autonomous agent pipelines that synthesize, reason, and act on heterogeneous data sources  
- Clinical-grade signal-processing & diagnostic systems for time-series data  
- Scalable analytics systems for high-throughput telemetry and event streams  
- End-to-end ML products with reproducible experimentation, model governance, and feature stores

---

## 🏆 Impact Highlights (Selected Outcomes)

- Clinical ECG risk-stratification with industry-grade classification performance (high accuracy / AUC) deployed as a real-time prototype  
- Real-time violence detection system with sub-50ms inference and major inference-cost reduction through model optimization and batching  
- Autonomous cyber-intelligence pipeline that synthesizes threat reports into actionable indicators and threat scores  
- Predictive maintenance models that demonstrably reduced operational downtime in production pilots  
- Multi-agent resume optimization pipeline enabling highly personalized candidate-job matching at scale

## ✅ Principles & Best Practices

- Reproducibility first: versioned datasets, experiment tracking, deterministic training seeds where feasible  
- Safety & interpretability: model cards, post-hoc explainers, and guardrails for agentic behavior  
- Cost-aware engineering: optimize for inference throughput and latency vs. accuracy trade-offs  
- Observability: metrics, logs, traces, and end-to-end SLOs for ML services  
- Data privacy & compliance: minimize PII in training loops, secure ingestion and storage

---

## 📚 Reproducible Artifacts & Deliverables

When available, projects include:
- Clear README and runbook describing local setup, training, and deployment steps  
- Notebooks or scripts to reproduce core results and evaluation metrics  
- Model cards and evaluation manifests listing datasets, metrics, and limitations  
- Dockerized inference + deployment manifests (Kubernetes Helm / k8s yaml when applicable)  
- CI workflows for tests, data checks, and model quality gates

---

## 🔧 Example repo layout (recommended)
- /data (ingestion & schema)  
- /notebooks (EDA, reproducible experiments)  
- /src (training, evaluation, inference code)  
- /infra (deployment manifests, dockerfiles, infra-as-code)  
- /experiments (tracked runs, hyperparams, metrics)  
- /docs (model cards, runbooks, API docs)

---

## 📈 Evaluation & Monitoring (typical setup)

- Offline: stratified cross-validation, OOD tests, class-wise metrics, calibration checks  
- Online: latency p95/p99, throughput, data drift, concept drift, prediction-coverage audits  
- Alerts: automated retrain triggers, performance regression blocking pipelines

## 📬 Contact & Repositories

- GitHub: [github.com/Mounika-Bolla](https://github.com/Mounika-Bolla)  

If you want, I can:
- produce a repository-ready README.md with badges and a project table of contents, or  
- tailor this README into a shorter one-page portfolio readme for GitHub front page.

Which version would you like me to generate and add (concise portfolio vs. repo-ready with badges and TOC)?
